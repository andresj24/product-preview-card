## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned to work with responsive design, the complexity consisted of changing the main image, since there is one for the desktop format and another for the mobile format, in addition, the content had to be ordered so that it would adapt according to the device where this component is displayed.

### Continued development

For future projects I will continue working on responsive design focusing on the mobile first methodology.
